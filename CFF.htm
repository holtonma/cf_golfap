        the middle of 2003, Albatross-Software.com initiated a program whereby
        they donate a percentage of each sale to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation
        (CFF), an organization with little overhead, allowing donations to reach
        the root cause. Researchers are making great strides toward a cure for
        cystic fibrosis, which affects approximately 30,000 children and adults
        in the United States. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation is the most
        efficient voluntary health organization of its kind with 89 cents of
        every dollar raised being made available for investment in CF research,
        care and education programs. Nicole Zimmerman, of the CFF Orlando
        chapter explains, &quot;the healthy percentage of sales that
        Albatross-Software.com has chosen to donate is warmly appreciated by the
        Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and is a generous model that we would
        encourage, from a enterprise of any size. We have a saying at the CFF
        'Adding Tomorrows Everyday' and donations like the ones from Albatross
        and others truly help the fight for a cure.&quot; To learn more about
        how to donate to this cause, in ways other than purchasing The Aviary
        software package, visit www.atross.com, or <a href="http://www.cff.org">www.cff.org</a>.&nbsp;
        Special thanks to Candice Nethercott for getting Albatross-Software.com
        involved in donations for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.</font></td>

        Genetics</i></b> : <i>Firm continues trial on cystic fibrosis</i>
        <p><b>SEATTLE TIMES 6/24/04</b> -- Targeted Genetics, a Seattle biotech
        company, said yesterday it will keep enrolling patients in a midstage
        clinical trial for its cystic-fibrosis treatment, after an independent
        committe took an early peek at the trail and found it has a chance to
        succeed.</p>
        <p>Targeted Genetics had scheduled the interim trial analysis to give it
        guidance on whether or not to pull the plug on the trail -- its most
        developed program -- or to keep investing in it.&nbsp; The double-blind,
        placebo-controlled trial has enrolled at least 53 patients so far, and
        plans are to enroll 100 by year's end.</p>
        <p>Last year, the company reported detailed results of a smaller trial
        that showed the treatment was safe.&nbsp; Although effectiveness
        diminished over time, it showed statistically significant effectiveness
        at improving breathing ability after 30 days.</td>
