      It is with great pleasure that Albatross has the opportunity to tell you
      about Todd Demsey's game and character.&nbsp; </font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Todd Demsey is an NCAA Division I
      Individual Champion from Arizona State, who has played the PGA Tour and
      Nationwide Tour since 1995, including a year on the PGA Tour in 1997.&nbsp;
      In 2003, despite undergoing two surgeries to remove a brain tumor, Demsey
      finished in the top 25 nine times, and completed the season with 17 of 22
      cuts made, good enough for 42nd on the money list.&nbsp; <b>A person with tremendous character
      and talent, look out for Todd Demsey in 2004 and beyond!&nbsp; </b>This is
      a golfer with a history of success, a passion for the game, and a
      tremendous amount of character.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">After qualifying for the US Open sectional,
      Demsey just missed qualifying in a playoff to make it to the United States Open
      Championship.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial" size="2">Check back weekly for updates on his
      performance on the Nationwide Tour and on to the PGA Tour.</font></p>
