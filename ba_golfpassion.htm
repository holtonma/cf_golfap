<p class="MsoNormal" align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">There are traits that “don’t show up on the stat
sheet”, as the saying goes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
cliché is omnipresent in all sports and all endeavors due to the truth behind
it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This holds particularly true in
the game of golf.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">In a telling conversation between BUY.com and PGA Tour player Brad Adamonis and
an amateur golfer this year, prior to the amateur’s first round in the US
Amateur sectional qualifier, the amateur asked “so, Brad, do you have any tips
prior to me teeing it up tomorrow---any last second advice?”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Adamonis’ reply was to the point:</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><font face="Arial" size="2">&nbsp;“This game is played with your heart and your head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Remember that.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to his talents as a ball striker (292.4 yard average on the BUY.com
tour), chipper and putter <a href="http://www.bradadamonis.com" style="color: #008000"> Brad
Adamonis</a><a style="color: #008000"> </a>is a player who has a passion for the
game, and a fiery competitive streak that is without parallel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While he has world class talents on the golf course (<a href="Brad_Adamonis.htm">see
Bio</a>), it is this
passion and competitive fire that has brought Adamonis to where he is today, and
that which will bring him to loftier competitive heights as he gains experience
on major professional golf tours.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is this passion that has driven him to mold his compact, powerful swing, refine
his touch, and learn from each success and failure.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">
Irrespective any stat, it is this inner drive that inspires.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">
 </span><font color="#003300"><i>It is in the fires of
this type of golf passion that Albatross-Software.com was forged.</i></font></b><span style="mso-spacerun:yes"><font color="#003300">
</font> </span>This desire to play the game at the best of one’s ability is
rare, like the double-eagle, or “Albatross”.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Many people claim this unique love for the game and drive to be their
best, though few bear the scars of those truly dedicated.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">
Go the practice tee at a local PGA Tour event this year, a Nationwide Tour
event, or even at your local country club.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You
will hear the clicks and cracks of irons and woods from players you may or may
not have heard of or seen, while watching them hit shots with piercing
trajectories on frozen ropes towards their targets.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why
are they lined up inside the ropes on that range, instead of you, or the pro down the street?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Why are this year’s US Amateur finalists, and US PubLinks champion
playing in the Masters instead of you, or why did your roommate make the college
golf team instead of you, or last year’s high school state champion win, while
you didn’t qualify?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sure there are
economic and physical factors that could be offered as reasons, or more
accurately, as excuses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But club,
state, regional, and national champions are crowned every year from public
courses without access to driving ranges---the simple truth is, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">they
wanted it more than you</i></b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">, </i>they’ve
probably wanted it for a longer than you, and they did whatever it took to
relentlessly hunt down their goal and bring it home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their passion drove them to find a way to win.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font face="Arial" size="2">
In many conversations with Adamonis over the course of his past year on the
BUY.com Tour, he’s explained, “All I can do, is prepare myself to play each
day to the best of my ability, and control my thoughts and emotions on the golf
course.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rest is out of my
hands.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
