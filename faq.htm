      has never been a golf software package like The Aviary<sup>TM</sup>.&nbsp;
      It was developed for two years by professional software engineers after
      numerous meetings and discussions with serious golfers of all
      levels.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      This application is more than statistics -- it is application that links
      together all golf related files of your life.&nbsp; Included in these are
      statistics, diaries, and other tools for the improvement of your game.<br>
      <br>
      Albatross-software.com's engineering staff included members with software
      experience gained from high technology companies located in Seattle, WA,
      as well as those who have had extensive competitive golf experience --
      this includes a high school state champion, high school All-American with
      Division I college golf experience, and a US Open Sectional qualifier.<br>
      <br>
      Albatross-software.com has also made it a priority to seek direct contact
      and counsel from a professional golfer with experience on the cutthroat
      Buy.com Tour, and PGA Tour; someone who has had successes throughout all
      stages of the rigorous the PGA Tour Qualifying school. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Due to his talents and passion for the game, <a href="Brad_Adamonis.htm">Brad
      Adamonis</a> is on the verge of dramatic successes in professional golf,
      and his insights have been and will continue to be incorporated into
      subsequent versions of The Aviary<sup>TM</sup>.&nbsp;
      <br>
      <br>
      It is the combination of all of these professionals, with vision and
      passion, that have led to a product that is truly unique and without
      parallel.</b></font></td>

      years and not run out of space.<br>
      Attaching many image files to your notes is permissible, and the amount of
      text and image data you can add to each note file is only limited by the
      size of your harddrive.&nbsp; Use the memory utility in &quot;The Golfer's
      Notebook&quot; section of The AviaryTM to view how much hard drive space
      you have available.

      drive space.&nbsp; This of course depends on the size, type and content of
      the image attached, but this is a valid &quot;rule of thumb&quot;.<br>
